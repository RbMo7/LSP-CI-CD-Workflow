# LSPP 2025 DevOps CI/CD Assignment Submission

## Assignment 1: The Build Verifier üõ†Ô∏è

### Deliverables

#### 1. Application & Repository
- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/RbMo7/LSP-CI-CD-Workflow
- **Application**: React "Hello World" app with custom styling and comprehensive messaging
- **Dockerfile**: Multi-stage Docker build configuration for production deployment

#### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
- **Workflow File**: `.github/workflows/build.yml`
- **Pipeline Structure**:
  - `test-job`: Runs comprehensive tests and build verification

- **Build Verification**: Tests include production build validation
- **Automation**: Tests must pass before Docker build can proceed

#### 4. Key Features Implemented
- ‚úÖ Custom React application with DevOps-themed content
- ‚úÖ Dockerfile with Node.js Alpine base image
- ‚úÖ Multi-job GitHub Actions workflow
- ‚úÖ Job dependencies using `needs:` keyword
- ‚úÖ Automated testing and build verification
- ‚úÖ Production-ready containerization
